## Introduction

## Project Title

Crunching the Numbers: A Comprehensive Data Analysis of the Indian Startup Ecosystem from 2018-2021.

## Business Understanding

In order to comprehend the factors that lead to start-up success, the problem entails analyzing the funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. The objective is to find patterns and trends in the data on financing amounts, investor details, and start-up information and to use these revelations to make inferences about the traits of Indian start-ups that are likely to succeed. Utilizing statistical techniques and methods, the study may look at the effects of start-up performance on funding levels, investor diversity, location, industry specialization, innovation, and founding team experience. Investors, business people, and policy makers who want to comprehend the dynamics of the Indian start-up ecosystem and come up with ideas such as start-up promotion may find the analysis' findings helpful.

## Hypothesis
- Null Hypothesis:
Investment in the Indian ecosystem is not biased towards any of the sectors

- Altenate Hypothesis:
Investments in the Indian ecosystem is biased towards at least one sector

## Questions

- Can the age of the startup influence the sum of money received from investors? 

- Has the amount of investments in the ecosystem increased over the 4 year span (the datasets we are looking at), or has it decreased?

- Which sectors’ startups are likely to eventually lose funding completely in the near future?/Which one has a decreasing trend in amount of funds received.

- Are start-ups located in specific areas more likely to succeed or to receive more
  financing than those located other areas?

- Are there any investors who specialize in specific areas or industries?

- Does the nature of the industry have any correlation on funding?

- What is the average investment amount received by Indian startups at different investment stages?


## Hypothesis Testing 

Null Hypothesis Companies whose headquaters are located in the Indian capital city, New delhi) receive more funding than that of those located other cities

Alternate Hypothesis Companies whose headquaters are located in the Indian capital city, New delhi) does not necessarilly receive more funding than that of those located in other cities

To test the hypothesis, we will need to find out which city's startups received the highest funding. If this city is not New Delhi then we further need to find out the average funding received by startups in New Delhi and further compare it with the city with the highest funding.

the plot that visualizes the "Means of funding amounts per Top 15 Headquaters" in question four already shows that Mumbai is the leading City. to get a better sense of how much Mumbai is leading New Delhi, we will plot below the mean of all fundings in New Delhi
